Regular expressions are used for parsing user inputs, while multithreading ensures smooth and responsive interactions without delays. The chatbot can process FAQs, execute command-based queries, and log conversation data through efficient file handling. Its architecture is extendable, allowing integration with APIs for functionalities like weather updates or news retrieval. Designed with scalability in mind, the chatbot showcases expertise in Python programming, data structures, and software development. Future enhancements include incorporating speech recognition and machine learning for better contextual understanding.
